title=Authentication system based on a microservices architecture
description=A complete authentication system built in a spirit of microservices architecture. It consists of ten cooperating applications which provides 3-factor (email-password, code card and Facebook OAuth) authentication management and an exemplary business application that allows logged-in users to monitor one of the Bitcoin exchanges in a customized way. This activator template demonstrates how different elements of Typesafe Reactive Platform could be combined to build a truly reactive, microserivce-based application.
